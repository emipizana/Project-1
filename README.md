* Random Forest
* Multiple Regression

## Project Description
The data has been taken from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/restaurant-revenue-prediction/data). The first thing was to get some insight of the data, the structure and missing values. There were no missing values, but some variables needed some manipulation such as the open date variable. After a deeper analysis of the data, variable scaling and dummification we used a multiple regression model and a random forest. The prediction was made with the random forest due to the higher accuracy.
